improvements:

due date!!

deal with NEWLINE issue (<br> not being saved into the json as it is saving the object title text not the html text...)

object can have multiple tags, for example one object has tag: schoolwork AND math

add number of importance shown somewhere?

organize order of tabs YOURSELF

dropdown menu implementation for tabs instead of typing?

use another framework other than electron to save space BECAUSE ELECTRON IS YUGEEEE

organize by date, separate div for sorting through dates?

create your own color palettes, show recently used colors....
